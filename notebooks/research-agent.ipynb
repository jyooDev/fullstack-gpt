That operation matches the style of the XZ Utils backdoor far more than the cruder supply chain attacks of APT41 or Lazarus, by comparison. \"It could very well be someone else,\" says Aitel. A backdoor was planted in the XZ utils package, a popular open-source compression utility for Linux/UNIX systems, by a threat actor named JiaT75. The backdoor exploited the SSH protocol to gain remote access and control over affected devices. The back door part comes into play with one of the main ways xz is used - SSH. SSH is an encrypted protocol between two machines where text commands can be exchanged, allowing a user to interact with a server. It's a very common utility in the Linux world and the security of this communication is critical. A malicious code inserted into a Linux compression tool by a developer named JiaT75 could have compromised millions of systems via SSH. A Microsoft worker discovered the backdoor and alerted the open source community, preventing a major disaster.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m\n",

      "Summary: In February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux utility xz within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an account using the name \"Jia Tan\". The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution capabilities on the affected Linux system. The issue has been given the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures number CVE-2024-3094 and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.\n",
      "While xz is commonly present in most Linux distributions, at the time of discovery the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed to production systems, but was present in development versions of major distributions. The backdoor was discovered by the software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on 29 March 2024.\n",

      "Summary: XZ Utils (previously LZMA Utils) is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors, including the programs lzma and xz, for Unix-like operating systems and, from version 5.0 onwards, Microsoft Windows. For compression/decompression the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is used. XZ Utils started as a Unix port of Igor Pavlov's LZMA-SDK that has been adapted to fit seamlessly into Unix environments and their usual structure and behavior.\n",

      "Page: Backdoor (computing)\n",
      "Summary: A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a \"homunculus computer\"—a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology). Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.\n",
      "A backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have \"legitimate\" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.\n",
      "Many systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system. Default passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version. In 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system, the Clipper chip, with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access. The chip was unsuccessful.\n",
      "Recent proposals to counter backdoors include creating a database of backdoors' triggers and then using neural networks to detect them.\n",

The issue has been given the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures number CVE-2024-3094 and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.[3][4]\\nWhile xz is commonly present in most Linux distributions, at the time of discovery the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed to production systems, but was present in development versions of major distributions.[5] The backdoor was discovered by the software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on 29 March 2024.[6]\\n\\n\\nBackground[edit]\\nMicrosoft employee and PostgreSQL developer Andres Freund reported the backdoor after investigating a performance regression in Debian Sid.[7] Freund noticed that SSH connections were generating an unexpectedly high amount of CPU usage as well as causing errors in Valgrind,[8] a memory debugging tool.[9] Freund reported his finding to Openwall Project\\'s open source security mailing list,[8] which brought it to the attention of various software vendors.[9] The attacker made efforts to obfuscate the code,[10] as the backdoor consists of multiple stages that act together.[11]\\nOnce the compromised version is incorporated into the operating system, it alters the behavior of OpenSSH\\'s SSH server daemon by abusing the systemd library, allowing the attacker to gain administrator access.[11][9] According to the analysis by Red Hat, the backdoor can \"enable a malicious actor to break sshd authentication and gain unauthorized access to the entire system remotely\".[12]\\nA subsequent investigation found that the campaign to insert the backdoor into the XZ Utils project was a culmination of approximately three years of effort, between November 2021 and February 2024,[13] by a user going by the name Jia Tan and the nickname JiaT75 to gain access to a position of trust within the project. After a period of pressure on the founder and head maintainer to hand over the control of the project via apparent sock puppetry, Jia Tan gained the position of co-maintainer of XZ Utils and was able to sign off on version 5.6.0, which introduced the backdoor, and version 5.6.1, which patched some anomalous behavior that could have been apparent during software testing of the operating system.[9]\\nSome of the suspected sock puppetry pseudonyms include accounts with usernames like Jigar Kumar, krygorin4545, and misoeater91. It is suspected that the names Jia Tan, as well as the supposed code author Hans Jansen (for versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1) are pseudonyms chosen by the participants of the campaign. Neither have any sort of visible public presence in software development beyond the short few years of the campaign.[14][15]\\nThe backdoor was notable for its level of sophistication and for the fact that the perpetrator practiced a high level of operational security for a long period of time while working to attain a position of trust. American security researcher Dave Aitel has suggested that it fits the pattern attributable to APT29, an advanced persistent threat actor believed to be working on behalf of the Russian SVR.[13] Journalist Thomas Claburn suggested that it could be any state actor or a non-state actor with considerable resources.[16]\\n\\nMechanism[edit]\\nThe malicious code is known to be in 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 releases of the XZ Utils software package. The exploit remains dormant unless a specific third-party patch of the SSH server is used. Under the right circumstances this interference could potentially enable a malicious actor to break sshd authentication and gain unauthorized access to the entire system remotely.[12] The malicious mechanism consists of two compressed test files that contain the malicious binary code. These files are available in the git repository, but remain dormant unless extracted and injected into the program.[2] The code uses the glibc IFUNC mechanism to replace an existing function in OpenSSH called RSA_public_decrypt with a malicious version. OpenSSH normally does not load liblzma, but a common third-party patch used by several Linux distributions causes it to load libsystemd, which in turn loads lzma.[2] A modified version of build-to-host.m4 was included in the release tar file uploaded on GitHub, which extracts a script that performs the actual injection into liblzma. This modified m4 file was not present in the git repository; it was only available from tar files released by the maintainer separate from git.[2] The script appears to perform the injection only when the system is being built on an x86-64 Linux system that uses glibc and GCC and is being built via dpkg or rpm.[2]\\n\\nResponse[edit]\\nRemediation[edit]\\nThe US federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has issued a security advisory recommending that the affected devices should roll back to a previous uncompromised version.[17] Linux software vendors, including Red Hat, SUSE, and Debian, have reverted the affected packages to older versions.[12][18][19] GitHub disabled the mirrors for the xz repository before subsequently restoring them.[20]\\nCanonical postponed the beta release of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and its flavours by a week and opted for a complete binary rebuild of all the distribution\\'s packages.[21] Although the stable version of Ubuntu was unaffected, upstream versions were. This precautionary measure was taken because Canonical could not guarantee by the original release deadline that the discovered backdoor did not affect additional packages during compilation.[22]\\n\\nBroader response[edit]\\nxkcd no. 2347 Dependency xkcd comic no. 2347 Dependency has been frequently referenced by commentators for capturing the predicament of a single unpaid volunteer maintaining critical, widely depended-upon software.[23][24]\\nComputer scientist Alex Stamos opined that \"this could have been the most widespread and effective backdoor ever planted in any software product\", noting that had the backdoor remained undetected, it would have \"given its creators a master key to any of the hundreds of millions of computers around the world that run SSH\".[25] In addition, the incident also started a discussion regarding the viability of having critical pieces of cyberinfrastructure depend on unpaid volunteers.[26]\\nNotes[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ The vulnerability was effectively patched within hours of discovery by reverting to a previous version known to be safe.\\n\\n^ Whether Jia Tan is a group of people, a real name of a single person or a pseudonym of a single person is not known publicly.\\n\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ Collin, Lasse. \"Remove the backdoor found in 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 (CVE-2024-3094)\".

      "Invoking: `SaveFileTool` with `{'doc': '# XZ Utils Backdoor\\n\\n## Overview\\nIn February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux utility xz within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an account using the name \"Jia Tan\". The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution capabilities on the affected Linux system. The issue has been given the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures number CVE-2024-3094 and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.\\n\\n## Discovery\\nThe backdoor was discovered by software developer Andres Freund, who reported it on 29 March 2024 after investigating performance issues in Debian Sid. Freund noticed unusual CPU usage during SSH connections, which led to the discovery of the backdoor.\\n\\n## Mechanism\\nThe malicious code is present in the 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 releases of the XZ Utils software package. It remains dormant unless a specific third-party patch of the SSH server is used. The backdoor alters the behavior of OpenSSH\\'s SSH server daemon, allowing unauthorized remote access.\\n\\n## Response\\nThe US federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a security advisory recommending that affected devices roll back to a previous uncompromised version. Major Linux distributions reverted the affected packages to older versions.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nThe XZ Utils backdoor incident highlights the vulnerabilities in open-source software maintenance and the potential for sophisticated supply chain attacks. It raises concerns about the reliance on unpaid volunteers for critical software infrastructure.\\n\\n## References\\n- Wikipedia: [XZ Utils backdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor)'}`\n",
